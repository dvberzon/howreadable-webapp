structure 2

test_case -> * exercises
test_case -> 2 patterns

when agree to do a test:
- we need to select a random test_case
then create responses for that test case? randomising the order of which pattern is shown

We could just store the sequence within the response

or we could store the order within a a model with

participant_id
test_case_id
pattern_sequence serialised

participant_test_case
participant_id
test_case_id
exercise_patterns
