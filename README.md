# HOWREADABLE

The /experiment folder has all the details of the different test cases and the examples to compare

/experiment/experiment.yml defines the diffrent test cases and their metadata.

the rest of the files in experiment are the test case examples. They are all named in the form

<example>.<lang>

eg

if a test case has an example called 'ifelse' and languages: 'rb' and 'js', the files would be

ifelse.rb
ifelse.js
